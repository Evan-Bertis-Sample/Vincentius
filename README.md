# Vincentius
## Pompeii is in danger.

Down below, within the crust of the earth, molten rock spews, and rivers of fire begin to flood.

Slowly but surely, the fires are climbing their way up the mountain you call Mount Vesuvius.

The Mountain can only contain the inferno for one more day. When the sundial hits noon, the flame will annex Pompeii, casting the land in fire.

Salus, the Roman goddess of welfare and safety, calls Vincentius to embark on a journey to the top of the mountain, in a desperate attempt to save Pompeii. The clock is ticking, as Vincentius only has 12 hours before the Pompeii is coated in ashes.

*He cannot do it alone.*

Join Vincentius on his journey up the mountain, and as he is thrown into the drama of Roman gods and goddesses. Who knows, maybe the eruption is whatâ€™s best for Rome.
